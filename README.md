## About me :
 :raised_hand_with_fingers_splayed:Hello everyone! I'm Fred Nobre, currently undergoing a career transition into the field of web development. Holding a Bac+2 equivalence in web and mobile web development, I've decided to follow my passion and further my education by becoming a web application developer at Simplon, while also putting my skills into practice through an apprenticeship at Octo Technologie.

My heart lies in front-end development, where I showcase my talents using technologies like JavaScript and React. In my quest for improvement, I've also embarked on learning TypeScript. On the back-end, I'm proficient with Java and Java SpringBoot, and I have some knowledge of Docker.

Beyond the realm of development, I nurture other passions in my life. Music :musical_note:,football :football:, cycling :biking_man:, reading :open_book: , and cooking:man_cook: all play significant roles in my daily routine.

Always eager for new discoveries and opportunities, I'm open to discussions and collaborations. If you have interesting projects or ideas to share, feel free to reach out to me! #webdeveloper #JavaScript #React #TypeScript #Java #SpringBoot #Simplon #OctoTechnologie #passionate #curious #webdevelopment #frontend #backend #technology #learning #motivated #LinkedIn
